# RPS-Multiplayer

A multi-player rock, paper, scissors game

Takes any player ID entered and either finds or adds that player.

Waits until two players (and not more!) log on.

Allows them to play, reports results and keeps score.

Allows for (rather crude) messaging between the players.

Gets confused if you quit before you've finished a game.  The confusion should be temporary.
